His teachings, along with those of Eckhart Tolle and Sodo Yokoyama, have shaped how I aim to move through the day.

The photos above reflect the feeling behind the app. Below are some of the designs I explored in Figma as I built it out. For greater ideas on the mood I wanted to capture within the application:
